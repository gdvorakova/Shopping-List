# Shopping List
Web Applications course Semester Project course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University.

## Description
The goal is to develop a simple web application with PHP and JavaScript that allows the user to edit a shopping list and includes an autocomplete feature. The shopping list consists of an ordered set of items (i.e., an item cannot occur multiple times in the list and the order of items matters). Each item is associated with an amount value (an integer specifying quantity). The list supports the following operations:

* Insertion of a new item by submitting a form under the shopping list (filled in with the name of the item and desired amount/quantity).
* Deletion of items from the list.
* Editing the amount associated with each item.
* Modification of the order of the items on the list.
